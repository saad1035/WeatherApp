# WeatherApp
# An application that showcases the current weather, hi/low, and date for various places across the world all with the help of openweathermap api. 
# A live demo of the application can be viewed through this link: https://weatherappdemo.netlify.app

# General Description 
This weather app was created through the use of JS, CSS and HTML. In addition, it utilizes openweathermap api that retrieves data regarding weather around the world. 

# Inspiration
Especially since I was new to JS, CSS, HTML, I found that creating a weather app would be a good starting project. In addition, I was also interested in exploring how api's functioned, so incorporating an api into my project, was another reason as to why I wanted to create a weather app.

# Challenges
I wasn't that proficient with the languages and apis so I had to learn a long the way. None the less, it was a great learning experience. I found styling to be very time consuming, but in the end, it was all worth it. 

# What I've Learned
Although this wasn't an extensive and enduring project, I was still able to takeway substantial skills that will help me out in future projects. I was able to gain technical skills such as working with JS, CSS and HTML, and being able to learn how to use APIs. On the other hand, I was also able to pick up skils that aren't so technical as well. These include time management, working through roadbumps and many more. 

# What's Next
I find that there is still a lot of room for this Weather App to be well developed. Many features and components can be added to enhance the overall app. One possible feature that I aim to add is the change of background based on various factors such as weather and time. In addition, I also wish to add more styling components and animation making it more visually appealing. Finally, with the use of databases and backend, I aim to create a feature that allows users to save specific locations and weathers.
